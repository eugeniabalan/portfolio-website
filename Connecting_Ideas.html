        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>Context and Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          The idea of creating a native app for the teachers and educators came from my background in pedagogy. After more than six years experience of
          working with children, I came to my conclusion that the most difficult part of the working day for a pedagog is to win again the control
          over the group of children once they are bored and look for new challenges. Finding rapid pedagogical ideas for an excited group of children is not such
          an easy mission.
          The purpose of Connceting Ideas is to help teacher and educators find rapid daily inspiration for their job and create a community to support each other.
        </p>
        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Design a mobile app for iOS and Android that solves a specific user problem. Come up with the concept, app name, objective, brand logo, competitive research,
          potential users and key features.
        </p>
        <h3>The Problem I Want to Solve</h3>
        <p>
        The need for finding rapid pedagogical ideas and the need for creating a community

        <h3>The Solution I am Proposing</h3>
        <p>
          Creating a native mobile app that solves the problem of finding rapid craft ideas for different ages of children to keep them occupied.
          The app has a specific feature called "Rapid craft ideas" that makes it stand out from the other competitors.

    <h1>Discovery</h1>
    <h2>Objectives Setting</h2>
    <p>
      At this phase I set the objectives of the project, using the 5W questions.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Who ist the app for?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The app is for the teaching staff who looks for daily inspiration in their work with children.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What kind of tasks will users complete as they use the app?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Users will be able to: create a profile (with the specification about the age of children they are working with); share the ideas they like, search for
      ideas of all levels of difficulty; review and comment others' ideas.
    </p>
    <h4>
      When will the audience use the app?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Users can use the app before preparing for a new working day or in difficult parts of the day, when they should come up with new ideas to keep
      the group occupied.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Where will your audience use the app?
    </h4>
    <p>
    Users can use the app everywhere: at home, at work, in public transport or on their way to work.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Why is your product more suited to a native mobile app than a responsive web app?
  </h4>
  <p>
    My product is more suited to a native mobile app because it's more convinient to use it. It's main characteristics are easy to use, accessible everywhere,
    and always at hand. It is meant to be a "pocket assurance" for the teaching staff in the moment they need to bring new ideas.

    <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      After understanding the problem and setting the objectives of the product, I conducted a SWOT competitor analysis for Kids Craft Ideas, Diy Crafts for Kids,
      Preschool Craft Ideas and DIY Paper Craft.
