        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The number of recipe products available on the web is astonishing. Yet the experience of finding recipes that work for anyone
          in different scenarios can be overwhelming. Perhaps the ingredients aren't available locally, or they are too expensive. Some of the recipes take too much time and
          the instructions are impossible to follow and/or the reviews are terrible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever the dilemma is, the fact is that there is a large number of recipe products out there that do not meet the needs of their users. Creating a web app that meets
          all these needs and solves some other important issues is more than necessary.

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Easy Cooking is a responsive web app where the user can find easy recipes to use at any time of the day! The recipes are
      accessible to everyone. The user has the opportunity to order local ingredients from local markets.

    <h1>Discovery</h1>
    <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      At this phase I analyzed the competitors through user psychology. I evaluated design principles, patterns, user behaviors which the competition uses to keep
      the users engaged. This helped me shape a concept of the design I intend to create.

    <h2>Main insights</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Applying the Hick's Law helps the user to take a decision easier.
      </li>
      <li>
        A personalized approach makes the user feel unique and special.
      </li>
      <li>
        Creating the design based on "Operant Conditioning and Addiction" pattern can make the user feel "punished" if he/she doesn't
        agree to accept to take the call to actions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using Dark Patterns in design can determine the user leave the app/website and never come back.
      </li>
      <li>
        Creating trust and focusing on the user personality is one of the most important ways to create a good user experience.

    <h2>Conducting User Research</h2>
    <p>
      After analyzing the competition, I conducted user research through the Research Learning Spiral.
    </p>
    <h3>STEP 1: Setting the objectives (5W's)</h3>
    <h4>
      Who are you designing for?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I am designing for 30 to 49 year old people who enjoy cooking using a cooking web app/website. The user I am designing for is not afraid to
      try new recipes.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What kind of tasks and goals will your audience be accomplishing as they use your website or app?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The user will learn to cook fast and healthy food. The user will have the opportunity to learn about what he/she is cooking.
      The user will explore new recipes with accessible ingredients in the local markets.
    </p>
    <h4>
      When will your audience be engaging with your product?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The user can use the web app at any time of the day, when he/she decides to cook.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Where will your audience be using what you are designing?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The user can use the web app anywhere.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Why is your audience choosing to use what you design?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The user will choose namely the web app I am designing because he/she can discover that cooking healthy food doesn't necessary need
      to take a lot of time. He/she might find out that cooking can be a joy, not a burden!
    </p>
    <h4>
      How will your user accomplish his/her goals?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The user will be able to find the most important functionalities of the web app easily and access them.
    </p>
    <h3>STEP 2: Formulating a hypothesis to use as a foundation of the research</h3>
    <p>
      Cooking healthy food doesn't need to take more time than fast food.
    </p>
    <h3>STEP 3: Conducting user interviews to get a sense of potential users</h3>
    <p>
      On this stage I formulated sets of questions regarding the cooking behavior of the potential users. I then conducted user interviews with
      seven users between 30 and 49 years old.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Question Set 1:
    </h4>
    <p>
      How often do you cook?
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you eat more fast food or home cooked food?
    </p>
    <h4>
      Question Set 2:
    </h4>
    <p>
      Where are you getting your recipes?
    </p>
    <h4>
      Question Set 3:
    </h4>
    <p>
      Most of the times, do you cook alone or with some company?
    </p>
    <h4>
      Question Set 4:
    </h4>
    <p>
      Do you always cook the same recipes or you like exploring new ones?
    </p>
    <p>
      What exactly do you like to cook the most? Why?
    </p>
    <h4>
      Question Set 5:
    </h4>
    <p>
      What was the last online resource you used to get a recipe?
    </p>
    <p>
      What did you like about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      What didn't you like about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      What features do you think a useful cooking app/website should contain?
    </p>
    <h4>
      Question Set 6:
    </h4>
    <p>
      Where do you buy the ingredients for your cooking?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why exactly are you shopping there?
    </p>
    <h3>STEP 4: Analysing the patterns, frustrations, needs/goals of the users. Synthesising the feedback</h4>
      <h4>Common Patterns</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>All the users I interviewed cook daily</li>
        <li>They all get inspiration from online websites or web apps</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Frustrations with the Actual Cooking Web Apps</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Either the description of the recipes is not clear or it's too complicated</li>
        <li>Unstructured content, too much information without clear categories</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Needs/Goals</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A clear categorization of recipes</li>
        <li>Attractive imagery</li>
        <li>Search suggestions</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Creating the User Flow Diagram</h2>

      At this stage, I created a user flow for each of the user stories. Each user flow had an entry point and a success criteria. Based on the
      user flows, I built the final user flow diagram.

    <h3>Prototyping and Conducting a Usability Test</h3>
    <p>
      After sketching the low-fidelity wireframes, I wrote a usability test script and conducted usability testing with five participants. I tested the main functionalities of
      creating a profile, sign-in to your profile, search for a recipe and reading and writing a comment or review. I analyzed the results of the test through
      using Jakob Nielsen's error severity rating system. I proposed solutions for my design issues based on the test results.

      The next step in the process was to create a complete mockup of the Onboarding screen, consulting the mood board. I created a variation of this screen, using different images for the two versions of the screen.
      After that I uploaded the design variations on the UsabilityHub, labelling each of them clearly. I waited to have minimum ten results to analyse which of the versions
      the participants prefer.

      As typefonts, I chose Quicksand in combination with Open Sans. The reason I chose Quicksand is because it creates a feeling of novelty, approachability
      and openness. This is what the product aims to express. Open Sans has excellent legibility, is clean and has a friendly approach. It fits perfect
      the brand value, of giving the product an approachable aspect. Together they give the product a modern and gettable look.

    <h3>Learnings</h3>
    <h4>#1</h4>
    <h4>Testing at Early Stages Help You Shape the Design Direction</h4>
    <p>
      Testing more and earlier is essential for the future of a product. Users' feedback helps the designer to solve and prevent small functionality problems before they become big ones.
    </p>
    <h4>#2</h4>
    <h4>Users' Feedback Can Change Our Perspective, but Not the Whole Direction</h4>
    <p>
      After getting feedback from the users, the designer can feel sometimes that the direction the product takes is totally wrong. It doesn't have to be so. I think we as designers should always
      keep in mind the customers' requirements, but be flexible about the perspective we have to approach the problem.
    <h4>#3</h4>
    <h4>Concentrate Your Design on Functionality</h4>
    <p>
      If you have to give up on some "decorative" element in your design to make it functional, do it! Nobody needs beautiful, but unfunctional products.
    </p>
    <h4>Have Some Fun on the Way</h4>
    <p>
      Meeting the deadlines is important, but also taking time in between to enjoy the process is a good practice. From time to time we need to detach ourselves to see new perspectives.
