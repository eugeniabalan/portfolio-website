        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The number of recipe products available on the web is astonishing. Yet the experience of finding recipes that work for anyone
          in different scenarios can be overwhelming. Perhaps the ingredients aren't available locally, or they are too expensive or the recipe takes too much time and
          the instructions are impossible to follow and/or the reviews of it are terrible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever the dilemma, the fact is that there is a large number of recipe products out there that do not meet the needs of their users. Creating a web app that meets
          all these needs and solves some other important issues is more than necessary.

        <p>
          Easy Cooking is a responsive web app, where the user can find easy recipes to use, any time of the day! The recipes are described in a language
          accessible for everyone. The user has the opportunity to order local ingredients from local markets.

          <h2>The Design Process</h2>
          <p>
            The design process has been broken down into two phases: UX Design phase and UI Design phase. Both phases followed the steps of User Centered
            Design and the Design Thinking process.

              I analysed the competitors through user psychology. I evaluated design principles, patterns, user behaviors the competition uses to keep
              the users engaged. This helped me shape a concept of the design I intend to create.

                  Applying the Hick's Law helps the user to take a decision easier.

                <li>
                  A personalized approach makes the user feel unique and special.

                <li>
                  Creating the design based on "Operant Conditioning and Addiction" pattern can make the user feel "punished" if he/she doesn't
                  agree to accept the call to actions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Using Dark Patterns in design can determine the user leave your app/website and never come back.

              <h3>Conducting User Research</h3>
              <p>
                After analysing the competition, I conducted user research through the Research Learning Spiral.
              </p>
              <h4>STEP 1: Setting the objectives (5W's)</h4>
              <p>
                Who are you designing for?
              </p>
              <p>
                I am designing for people of 30-49 years old who enjoy cooking using a cooking web app/website. The user I am designing for is not afraid to
                try new recipes.
              </p>
              <p>
                What kind of tasks and goals will your audience be accomplishing as they use your website or app?
              </p>
              <p>
                The user will learn to cook fast but healthy food. The user will have the opportunity to learn about what they are cooking.
                The user will explore new recipes with accessible ingredients in the local markets.
              </p>
              <p>
                When will your audience be engaging with your product?
              </p>
              <p>
                The user can use the web app any time of the day, when he/she decides to cook.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where will your audience be using what you are designing?
              </p>
              <p>
                The user can use the web app anywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why is your audience choosing to use what you design?
              </p>
              <p>
                The user will choose namely the web app I am designing because he/she can discover that cooking healthy food doesn't necessary need
                to take a lot of time. He/she might find out that cooking can be a joy, not a burden!
              </p>
              <p>
                How will your user accomplish his/her goals?
              </p>
              <p>
                The user will be able to find easily the most important functionalities of the web app and to access them.
              </p>
              <h4>STEP 2: Based on the answers from step 1, I formulated a hypothesis to use as a foundation of my research.</h4>
              <p>
                Cooking healthy food doesn't need to take more time than fast food.
              </p>
              <h4>STEP 3: Conducting User Interviews to get a better sense of potential users.</h4>
              <p>
                On this stage I formulated sets of questions regarding the cooking behavior of the potential users. I then conducted user interviews with
                five to ten users aged 30-49 years old.
              </p>
              <p>
                Question Set 1:
              </p>
              <p>
                How often do you cook?
              </p>
              <p>
                Do you eat more fast food or home cooked food?
              </p>
              <p>
                Question Set 2:
              </p>
              <p>
                Where are you getting your recipes?
              </p>
              <p>
                Question Set 3:
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the times, do you cook alone or with some company?
              </p>
              <p>
                Question Set 4:
              </p>
              <p>
                Do you always cook the same recipes or you like exploring new ones?
              </p>
              <p>
                What exactly do you like to cook the most? Why?
              </p>
              <p>
                Question Set 5:
              </p>
              <p>
                What was the last online resource you used to get a recipe?
              </p>
              <p>
                What did you like about it?
              </p>
              <p>
                What didn't you like about it?
              </p>
              <p>
                What features do you think a useful cooking app/website should contain?
              </p>
              <p>
                Question Set 6:
              </p>
              <p>
                Where do you buy the ingredients for your cooking?
              </p>
              <p>
                Why exactly are you shopping there?
              </p>
              <h4>STEP 4: Analysing the patterns, frustrations, needs/goals of the users. Synthesising the feedback.</h4>
              <h4>Common Patterns</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>All the user I interviewed cook daily</li>
                <li>They all get inspiration from online websites or web apps</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Frustrations With the Actual Cooking Web Apps</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Either the description of the recipes is not clear or it's too complicated</li>
                <li>Unstructured content, too much information without clear categories</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Needs/Goals</h4>
              <ul>

                                  <p>
                                    On this stage, I created a user flow for each of the user stories. Each user flow had an entry point and a success criteria. Based on the
                                    user flows, I built the final user flow diagram.
                                  </p>
