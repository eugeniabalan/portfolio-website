                  Create a responsive web app for people who do not like
                  to deal with their finances.
                  Give users clear information about what they can do to better save.

                  <h3>Prototyping & User Testing</h3>
                  <p>
                    After designing the mid-fidelity wireframes, I created a prototype in inVision. I conducted a scenario-based
                    user testing with more than ten users. I tested the main functionalities of the app.
                  </p>
                  <h4>User Testing Analysis</h4>
                  <p>
                    I categorized the problems in critical and preferential.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Critical problems:
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    - Confuzing diagrams of expenses and incomes.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Recommendation</h4>
                  <p>
                  Chanange the correct numbers in the diagram, make a percentage difference through color highlights.
                  </p>
                      <p>
                        No exit option from the "Expenses" and "Incomes" screens.
                      </p>
                      <h4>Recommendation</h4>
                      <p>
                      Create a X button in the top right of the Expenses and Incomes screens/make them separate (not like windows on other screens)
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        No Overview for the total amount of money the user saved or spent in a month.
                      </p>
                      <h4>Recommendation</h4>
                      <p>
                      Consider writing an Overview for saved and spent money on the Home screen.
                      </p>
                      <h4>
                        Preferential problems:
                      </h4>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The user doesn't know exactly what the moeny are saved for.
                      </p>
                      <h4>Recommendation</h4>
                      <p>
                      Introduce an icon or an UI element that would show the user what his/her priority goals are.

                  <p>
                    Help people save rapid and painless for their future dreams.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Guiding principles</h4>
                  <p>
                    Reliability. Pocket Advisor is a reliable tool. It protects the user's data and keeps its promises
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mutual trust. The users trust Pocket Advisor and Pocket Advisor trusts the users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Simplicity. Pockets Advisor is a simple tool accessible for anyone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cooperation. Pocket Advisor doesn't function alone. The feedback of it's users is essential.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Typeface Choice</h4>
                  <p>
                    I chose Soleil typeface because it communicates freshness, dynamism and contemporary. It's a typeface based on the modernist ideas of
                    simplicity, clarity and reduction to the essential forms. It gives the product a friendly and approachable feeling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Soleil is combined with San Francisco typeface. San Francisco expresses seriosity and high quality.
                    Together they communicate trust and stability.

                    Emerald is a color of abundance, prosperity and growth. It transmits the energy of life, the peace of nature, renewal and stability.
                  </p>

                    Pacific blue communicates creativity and intelligence. It stands for loyality, strenghts, wisdom and trust.

                  <p>
                    The secondary colors are purple heart and black panther.

        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <h4>#1</h4>
        <h4>People need safety reassurance when it comes to their finances</h4>
        <p>
          People are skeptical when it comes to introducing somewhere their bank details. That's why a digital product in fintech should give assure
          the user that it is safe to use. One of the biggest learning was to not regret the time spent on concepting and creating a design that gives users trust.
        </p>
        <h4>#2</h4>
          <h4>Users do not always imagine the product as we do</h4>
          <p>
            One of the most important lesson I learnt doing this project is that the designer is not his user. He may think a project in a way and change completly
            his/her way of thinking after looking the real user interacting with the product. While we create and work on design concepts, we should always let some room
            for a potential change of direction after user testings.
        <h4>#3</h4>
        <h4>Simplicity in design looks elegant and professional</h4>
        <p>
          After testing with users the first version of design screens, I realized that users prefer simple and functional design for a financial app.
          With a simple, clear and elegant design it's easy to understand what the main functions of the product are and what each function does.
