                    People who don't like to deal with their finances find it difficult to create saving goals.
                    Knowing how much they spend and on what can help them make saving plans. Having an overview of all the expenditures, incomes and savings in a one place can make
                    the mission of saving easier.

      <h3>Learnings</h3>
      <h4>#1</h4>
      <h4>People need safety reassurances when it comes to their finances</h4>
      <p>
        People are skeptical when it comes to introducing somewhere their bank details. That's why a digital product in fintech should insure
        the user that it is safe to use. One of the biggest learning was to not regret the time spent on concepting and creating a design that makes your user trust your product.
      </p>
      <h4>#2</h4>
      <h4>Users do not always imagine the product as we do</h4>
      <p>
        One of the most important lesson I learnt doing this project is that the designer is not his user. He/she may think about a project in a way and change completely
        his/her way of thinking after looking the real user interacting with the product. While we create and work on design concepts, we should always let some room
        for a potential change of direction after user testings.
      <h4>#3</h4>
      <h4>Simplicity in design looks elegant and professional</h4>
      <p>
        After testing with users the first version of design screens, I realized that users prefer simple and functional design for a financial app.
        With a simple, clear and elegant design it's easy to understand what the main functions of the product are and what each function does.
